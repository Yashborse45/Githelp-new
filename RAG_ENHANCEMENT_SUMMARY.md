# Enhanced RAG Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that provides rich context to Gemini AI for answering questions about repository code.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Enhanced Context Retrieval** (`src/server/qa.ts`)
- **Increased retrieval count**: Now fetches top 10 similar documents (previously 5)
- **Similarity threshold**: Only includes matches with score > 0.5 for relevance
- **Structured context construction**: Format mirrors your suggested pattern:

```typescript
// For each relevant code chunk:
context += `Source: ${metadata.path}\n`;
context += `Code Content: ${metadata.text}\n`;
context += `Summary of File: ${metadata.summary}\n`;
context += `Relevance Score: ${(match.score * 100).toFixed(1)}%\n\n`;
```

### 2. **Improved Chunking Strategy** (`src/server/rag.ts`)
- **Better chunk size**: Increased from 800 to 1200 characters with 300 char overlap
- **Smart boundary detection**: Breaks at natural code boundaries (newlines, braces, semicolons)
- **Enhanced metadata**: Stores full chunk content + summary for better context
- **Quality filtering**: Skips chunks smaller than 50 characters

### 3. **Structured Prompt Engineering**
- **Context integration**: Clear separation between code context and user question
- **Detailed instructions**: Specific guidance for AI to analyze code, cite sources, and provide comprehensive answers
- **Enhanced token limit**: Increased from 1500 to 2000 tokens for more detailed responses

### 4. **Better File Reference System**
- **Rich citations**: Include file path, chunk index, and code excerpt
- **Relevance scoring**: Shows similarity percentage for each reference
- **Limited display**: Top 5 citations for clean UI

## RAG Flow Implementation

### Step 1: Query Vector Generation
```typescript
const qEmbedding = (await embedTexts([question]))[0];
```

### Step 2: Similarity Search (Pinecone)
```typescript
const queryResp = await queryVectors(qEmbedding, 10, projectId);
const matches = queryResp.matches.filter(m => m.score > 0.5);
```

### Step 3: Context Augmentation
```typescript
// Structured context building with file sources, code content, and summaries
for (const match of matches) {
    context += `Source: ${metadata.path}\n`;
    context += `Code Content: ${metadata.text}\n`;
    context += `Summary of File: ${metadata.summary}\n\n`;
}
```

### Step 4: AI Generation with Context
```typescript
const prompt = `You are an AI code assistant...
Context from Repository:
${context}

User Question: ${question}
...`;
const answerText = await chatCompletion(prompt, 2000);
```

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Repository-Aware Responses**: AI now has access to actual project code context
2. **Better Code Understanding**: Structured context helps AI understand file relationships
3. **Accurate Citations**: Users can see exactly which files inform each answer
4. **Relevance Filtering**: Only high-quality, relevant code chunks are included
5. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Larger context window allows for detailed explanations

## Usage Example

When a user asks: *"How does authentication work in this project?"*

The system will:
1. Convert question to embedding vector
2. Find top 10 most similar code chunks from the project
3. Filter to only highly relevant matches (>50% similarity)
4. Construct structured context with auth-related files
5. Generate comprehensive answer citing specific files and explaining the authentication flow

## Technical Stack
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone for similarity search
- **Embeddings**: Gemini text embeddings for semantic understanding
- **Generation**: Gemini 1.5 Flash for response generation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for storing Q&A history
- **Filtering**: Project-specific context isolation

This implementation now provides the contextual awareness needed for meaningful code discussions while maintaining clean separation between different user projects.
